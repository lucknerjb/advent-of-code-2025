# Overview
Each day is in its own directory. Simply activate the environment - `source .venv/bin/activate` or use your default Python 3 installation as there are no requirements to install.

Each day can be run with `python main.py` and in some cases, a small edit to the code can be made to run Part 1 or Part 2 of the day.

For some of the days, I've kept some initial attempts I took at solving the issue in a file named `main_v1.py`

I'm ultimately pausing at Day 5 / Part 2 because this solution would require me to work with large ID ranges and my laptop simply cannot hold this data in memory.
